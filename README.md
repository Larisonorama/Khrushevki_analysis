# Topic

An analysis of the administrative district in Moscow with the high density of khrushevki as a district that is likely to be
reconstructed due to the Renovation Programme announced recently by the Moscow government. Horoshevo-Mnevniki was selected as
the area that suites to these parameters.
The goal was to analyse the district performance and how it might change after khrushevki demolition and new construction.
This research is rather preliminary and should not be treated as a complete comprehensive research.
